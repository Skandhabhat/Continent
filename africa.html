<h1 class="b"><center><b>Africa Continent</b></center></h1>
<p class="a">Africa, the second largest continent (after Asia), covering about one-fifth of the total land surface
     of Earth. The continent is bounded on the west by the Atlantic Ocean, on the north by the Mediterranean Sea, 
     on the east by the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, and on the south by the mingling waters of the Atlantic and
      Indian oceans.
</p>
<p class="a"> Africa’s total land area is approximately 11,724,000 square miles (30,365,000 square km), and the 
    continent measures about 5,000 miles (8,000 km) from north to south and about 4,600 miles (7,400 km) from east
     to west. Its northern extremity is Al-Ghīrān Point, near Al-Abyaḍ Point (Cape Blanc), Tunisia; its southern
      extremity is Cape Agulhas, South Africa; its farthest point east is Xaafuun (Hafun) Point, near Cape Gwardafuy 
      (Guardafui), Somalia; and its western extremity is Almadi Point (Pointe des Almadies), on Cape Verde (Cap Vert),
       Senegal. In the northeast, Africa was joined to Asia by the Sinai Peninsula until the construction of the Suez
        Canal. Paradoxically, the coastline of Africa—18,950 miles (30,500 km) in length—is shorter than that of Europe,
         because there are few inlets and few large bays or gulfs.</p>

<p class="a">With the exception of South Africa and the countries of North Africa, all of which have diversified 
    production systems, the economy of most of Africa can be characterized as underdeveloped. Africa as a whole has
     abundant natural resources, but much of its economy has remained predominantly agricultural, and subsistence
      farming still engages more than 60 percent of the population. <br>

    Until the beginning of the 20th century this system of farming relied on simple tools and techniques,
     as well as on traditional organization of the family or community for its labour. Because of poor transport 
     and communications, production was largely for domestic use. There was little long-distance trade, and wage 
     labour was virtually unknown. The small size and vast heterogeneity of polities at that time also made exchanges 
     very limited. There were, however, notable exceptions, especially in western Africa, where for many centuries
      societies had engaged in long-distance trade and had elaborate exchange and craft facilities, communications,
       and a political infrastructure to maintain their trade routes.</p>
