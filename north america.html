<p class="a">North America, third largest of the world’s continents, lying for the most part between the Arctic Circle and the Tropic of Cancer. It extends for more than 5,000 miles (8,000 km) to within 500 miles (800 km) of both the North Pole and the Equator and has an east-west extent of 5,000 miles. It covers an area of 9,355,000 square miles (24,230,000 square km).</p>
<p class="a">North America occupies the northern portion of the landmass generally referred to as the New World, the Western Hemisphere, or simply the Americas. Mainland North America is shaped roughly like a triangle, with its base in the north and its apex in the south; associated with the continent is Greenland, the largest island in the world, and such offshore groups as the Arctic Archipelago, the West Indies, Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands), and the Aleutian Islands.</p>
<p class="a"> North America is bounded on the north by the Arctic Ocean, on the east by the North Atlantic Ocean,
     on the south by the Caribbean Sea, and on the west by the North Pacific Ocean. To the northeast Greenland is
      separated from Iceland by the Denmark Strait, and to the northwest Alaska is separated from the Asian mainland
       by the much narrower Bering Strait. North America’s only land connection is to South America at the narrow
        Isthmus of Panama. Denali (Mount McKinley) in Alaska, rising 20,310 feet (6,190 metres) above sea level, is
         the continent’s highest point, and Death Valley in California, at 282 feet (86 metres) below sea level, is
          its lowest. North America’s coastline of some 37,000 miles (60,000 km)—the second longest of the continents 
          after Asia—is notable for the great number of indentations, particularly in the northern half.</p>

<p class="a">Few episodes in human history have been more remarkable than the economic transformation of North America since about 1700. During the pre-Columbian period, the territories that became the United States and Canada (sometimes called Anglo-America) were areas thinly settled by an aboriginal population that just had begun to practice agriculture on a local scale. In contrast, comparatively old and complex agrarian and urban civilizations had arisen in portions of Mexico and Central America, where relatively elaborate economies and dense populations had developed.</p>
