<h1 class="b"><center><b>Asia Continent</b></center></h1>

<p class="a">Asia, the world’s largest and most diverse continent. It occupies the eastern four-fifths of the giant Eurasian
     landmass. Asia is more a geographic term than a homogeneous continent, and the use of the term to describe such
      a vast area always carries the potential of obscuring the enormous diversity among the regions it encompasses. <br>
       Asia has both the highest and the lowest points on the surface of Earth, has the longest coastline of any 
       continent, is subject overall to the world’s widest climatic extremes, and, consequently, produces the most
        varied forms of vegetation and animal life on Earth. In addition, the peoples of Asia have established the
         broadest variety of human adaptation found on any of the continents.</p>

<p class="a">The name Asia is ancient, and its origin has been variously explained. The Greeks used it to designate the lands 
    situated to the east of their homeland. It is believed that the name may be derived from the Assyrian word asu,
     meaning “east.” Another possible explanation is that it was originally a local name given to the plains of Ephesus,
      which ancient Greeks and Romans extended to refer first to Anatolia (contemporary Asia Minor,
      which is the western extreme of mainland Asia), and then to the known world east of the Mediterranean Sea. 
      When Western explorers reached South and East Asia in early modern times, they extended that label to the whole
       of the immense landmass.</p>
<br>
<p class="a">While the economies of most Asian countries can be characterized as developing, there is enormous variation among
     them. The continent contains one of the world’s most economically developed countries, Japan, and several that are
      impoverished, such as Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Nepal. This variation has a regional dimension. Most of the 
      countries of Southwest Asia fall within one of the middle-income categories as defined by the World Bank.
       Exceptions are Israel and the Persian Gulf states of Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, which are
        considered high-income. Most of the countries of North and Central Asia fall within the low-income category,
         except Russia (Siberia), Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan, all considered lower-middle-income. Likewise, all the
          countries of South Asia are considered low-income, apart from lower-middle-income Sri Lanka. Except for China
           and North Korea, which are considered low-income, East Asia is the most prosperous part of the continent. <br>
            Most countries in this region are considered upper-middle-income, and Japan is considered high-income. 
            China, which has experienced dramatic rates of economic growth since the late 20th century, may be poised 
            to achieve lower-middle-income status. Many of the countries of Southeast Asia have likewise achieved high
             rates of growth and have moved into one of the middle-income categories or even, in the case of Singapore
              and Brunei, into the high-income category. Exceptions are Myanmar (Burma), Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam,
               which remain within the low-income group.</p>
